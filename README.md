# OS Simulator

This project aims to provide a simulated environment for exploring operating system concepts and understanding their technical aspects. The simulator is built using the C programming language, allowing users to interact with a simplified operating system.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a hands-on experience of working with operating systems through simulation. Users can explore various aspects of an operating system, such as process scheduling, memory management, and file system operations, within the controlled environment of the simulator.

### part 1

The first part The OS Simulator focuses on the following features:

Token Expansion: Enhances the "set" command to support up to 5 alphanumeric tokens. Explore command-line argument processing and token storage.

Echo Command Enhancement: Implements the "echo" command to display strings as arguments. Supports variable referencing and string manipulation.

Batch Mode Execution: Executes commands from a file, handles input, prevents infinite loops, and ensures controlled execution.

Adding New Commands: Expands functionality with commands like "my_ls," "my_mkdir," "my_touch," and "my_cd" for file system operations.

One-Liners: Executes multiple commands separated by semicolons, enabling complex operations.
